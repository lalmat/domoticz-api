# domoticz-api

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning** : Work in progress.

The goal of this project is to have an object to easely access a [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com) instance. Devices, user variables, send notifications, etc. will be accessible with just function calls. With Domoticz API, it's very easy to build awesome frontend with javascript frameworks like Vue / React / Angular.

This API uses the interfaces as defined at Domoticz API/JSON URL's. This page does not describe all available url's. This API also uses some 'undocumented' api url's.

## About Domoticz API
Domoticz API helps create a central sensor-controlled portal for synchronizing home utility devices ranging from electrical devices, electronic gadgets, water, and gas as well as weather monitoring instruments. It is a RESTful API that generates JSON returns from HTTP requests.

## This is a "working" but beta version

You can use this lib as an import, or directly thru the browser.

### Installation:

            useSSL : true,
            username: YOUR_USERNAME,
            password: YOUR_PASSWORD

## üéØ Todos:
I'm actually focused on retrieving datas (Events / Camera / Devices). Then, I'll add Domoticz management functions to add / delete devices, then I'll dig into Domoticz source code to get undocumented functions available.
